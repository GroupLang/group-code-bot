3. How it works:
   - Members send messages in the group
   - The bot collects messages and periodically generates document updates
   - Updates are posted to the document channel
   - Group members can approve or reject updates using inline buttons
   - Approved updates become the new current document
   - Contributors receive rewards for approved updates

## Document Generation Process

1. Message Collection
   - The bot collects text messages from the group
   - After collecting 5 messages, it triggers a document update

2. Update Generation
   - The bot uses MarketRouter AI to generate an updated document
   - The update considers both the current document and new messages
   - The goal is to maintain consensus while incorporating new information

3. Approval Process
   - Generated updates are posted to the document channel
   - Members can vote using üëç (approve) or üëé (reject) buttons
   - Approved updates replace the current document
   - Contributors receive rewards for approved updates
